1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,682
Jefferson has organized lots of events,

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,183
including the Oil Rig Field Trip,

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,019
where the Engineering Academy was able

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,755
to go to an Oil Rig, and then spend time at the beach.

5
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,490
and the Amazon Warehouse Field Trip.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,491
When I was President (2018-2019),

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,092
he was the Director of Activities.

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,695
Through fun events like our field trips, and the Rockets Social,

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,696
the Rockets Social

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,797
the Rockets Social

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,965
just beautifully executed

12
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,034
I can really say that joining the Academy was one of

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,735
the best decisions I’ve made in high school,

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,670
and Jefferson was a big part of that.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,173
He’s helped plan the Airplane Student Body Meeting.

16
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,775
Most of my favorite moments at the

17
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,778
Elkins Engineering Academy are because of his leadership.

18
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,679
Jefferson is the type of person who

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,348
gets the job done no matter what.

20
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,849
He’s extremely responsible,

21
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,418
a determined, hard-working guy.

22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,585
He’s always been dedicated

23
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,422
and strives to put his best foot forward.

24
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,091
He’s helped out every single club he’s been in.

25
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,994
I honestly can’t think of anyone more qualified than he is.

26
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,897
He’s very proactive, and he’s not afraid to take the lead.

27
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,499
And he has a track record of excellence in organizing events

28
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,435
that you want and you care about.

29
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,537
He’s also very focused and organized.

30
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,239
Jefferson has been one of the most helpful, productive,

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,742
and capable people I’ve ever met in my life.

32
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,043
He cares about how the members feel.

33
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,345
Everything he does is centered around you.

34
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,714
The internships that we had, the socials that we had,

35
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,317
it was initiated because the students wanted it.

36
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,819
Jefferson is a great friend

37
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,154
and an inspiring figure to have in your life.

38
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,522
He’s honestly just a chill person.

39
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,926
Jefferson is the best pick for Engineering Academy President.

40
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,094
It’s that simple!

41
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,295
Vote for Jefferson, 2020.

42
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:35,895
Vote for him.

43
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:36,896
Vote for Jefferson.

44
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,198
You should vote for Jefferson,

45
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,899
and I’m going to be too.

46
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,501
We hope to see him as the

47
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,338
2020-2021 Academy President!
